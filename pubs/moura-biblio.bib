               management research suggest that battery energy capacity
               requirements may be reduced through proper power management
               algorithm design. Specifically, algorithms which blend fuel and
               electricity during the charge depletion phase using smaller
               batteries may perform equally to algorithms that apply
               electric-only operation during charge depletion using larger
               batteries. The implication of this result is that ``blended''
               power management algorithms may reduce battery energy capacity
               requirements, thereby lowering the acquisition costs of PHEVs.
               This article seeks to quantify the tradeoffs between power
               management algorithm design and battery energy capacity, in a
               systematic and rigorous manner. Namely, we (1) construct dynamic
               PHEV models with scalable battery energy capacities, (2)
               optimize power management using stochastic control theory, and
               (3) develop simulation methods to statistically quantify the
               performance tradeoffs. The degree to which blending enables
               smaller battery energy capacities is evaluated as a function of
               both daily driving distance and energy (fuel and electricity)
               pricing.",

               of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), defined as the
               timing and rate with which the PHEV obtains electricity from the
               power grid. The optimization goal is to simultaneously minimize
               (i) the total cost of fuel and electricity and (ii) the total
               battery health degradation over a 24-h naturalistic drive cycle.
               The first objective is calculated for a previously-developed
               stochastic optimal PHEV power management strategy, whereas the
               second objective is evaluated through an electrochemistry-based
               model of anode-side resistive film formation in lithium-ion
               batteries. The paper shows that these two objectives are
               conflicting, and trades them off using a non-dominated sorting
               genetic algorithm. As a result, a Pareto front of optimal charge
               patterns is obtained. The effects of electricity price and trip
               schedule on the optimal Pareto points and the PHEV charge
               patterns are analyzed and discussed.",

               load imposed on the power grid by the battery health-conscious
               charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The
               article begins by generating a set of representative daily trips
               using (i) the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and (ii) a
               Markov chain model of both federal and naturalistic drive
               cycles. A multi-objective optimizer then uses each of these
               trips, together with PHEV powertrain and battery degradation
               models, to optimize both PHEV daily energy cost and battery
               degradation. The optimizer achieves this by varying (i) the
               amounts of charge obtained from the grid by each PHEV, and (ii)
               the timing of this charging. The article finally computes
               aggregate PHEV power demand by accumulating the charge patterns
               optimized for individual PHEV trips. The results of this
               aggregation process show a peak PHEV load in the early morning
               (between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.), with approximately half of all
               PHEVs charging simultaneously. The ability to charge at work
               introduces smaller additional peaks in the aggregate load
               pattern. The article concludes by exploring the sensitivity of
               these results to the relative weighting of the two optimization
               objectives (energy cost and battery health), battery size, and
               electricity price.",
